# Cloud Foundry Management (cf-mgmt)

Go automation for managing orgs, spaces, users (from ldap groups or internal store) mapping to roles, quotas, application security groups and private-domains that can be driven from concourse pipeline and GIT managed metadata

## Getting Started

### Install

Compiled [releases](https://github.com/pivotalservices/cf-mgmt/releases) are available on Github.
Download the binary for your platform and place it somewhere on your path.
Don't forget to `chmod +x` the file on Linux and macOS.

### Create UAA Client

cf-mgmt needs a uaa client to be able to interact with cloud controller and uaa for create, updating, deleting, and listing entities.  

```
uaac target uaa.<your system domain>
uaac token client get admin -s <your uaa admin client secret>
uaac client add cf-mgmt \
  --name cf-mgmt \
  --secret <client secret from cf-mgmt client> \
  --authorized_grant_types client_credentials,refresh_token \
  --authorities cloud_controller.admin,scim.read,scim.write
```

### Setup Configuration

Navigate into a directory in which will become your git repository for cf-mgmt configuration

1. Initialize git repository by either cloning a remote or using `git init`

2. You can either setup your configuration by using
  - [init](docs/config/init/README.md) command from cf-mgmt-config if you are wanting to start with a blank configuration and add the config using cf-mgmt-config operations
  - [export-config](docs/export-config/README.md) command from `cf-mgmt` if you have an existing foundation you can use this to reverse engineer your configuration.

3. *(optional)* Configure LDAP/SAML Options. If your foundation uses LDAP and/or SAML, you will need to configure ldap.yml with the correct values.
	- [LDAP only config](docs/config/README.md#ldap-configuration)
	- [SAML with LDAP groups](docs/config/README.md#saml-configuration-with-ldap-group-lookups)
	- [SAML only](docs/config/README.md#saml-configuration)

4. [Generate the concourse pipeline](docs/config/generate-concourse-pipeline/README.md) using cf-mgmt-config

5. Make sure you .gitingore the vars.yml file that is generated `echo vars.yml >> .gitignore`

6. Commit and push your changes to your git repository

7. fly your pipeline after you have filled in vars.yml

## Support

cf-mgmt is a community supported cloud foundry add-on.  Opening issues for questions, feature requests and/or bugs is the best path to getting "support".  We strive to be active in keeping this tool working and meeting your needs in a timely fashion.

## Build from the source

`cf-mgmt` is written in [Go](https://golang.org/).
To build the binary yourself, follow these steps:

* Install `Go`.
* Install [Glide](https://github.com/Masterminds/glide), a dependency management tool for Go.
* Clone the repo:
  - `mkdir -p $(go env GOPATH)/src/github.com/pivotalservices`
  - `cd $(go env GOPATH)/src/github.com/pivotalservices`
  - `git clone git@github.com:pivotalservices/cf-mgmt.git`
* Install dependencies:
  - `cd cf-mgmt`
  - `glide install`
  - `go build -o cf-mgmt cmd/cf-mgmt/main.go`
  - `go build -o cf-mgmt-config cmd/cf-mgmt-config/main.go`

To cross compile, set the `$GOOS` and `$GOARCH` environment variables.
For example: `GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build`.

## Testing

To run the unit tests, use `go test $(glide nv)`.

### Integration tests

There are integration tests that require some additional configuration.

The LDAP tests require an LDAP server, which can be started with Docker:

```
docker pull cwashburn/ldap
docker run -d -p 389:389 --name ldap -t cwashburn/ldap
RUN_LDAP_TESTS=true go test ./ldap/...
```

The remaining integration tests require [PCF Dev](https://pivotal.io/pcf-dev)
to be running and the CF CLI to be installed.

```
cf dev start
uaac target uaa.local.pcfdev.io
uaac token client get admin -s admin-client-secret
uaac client add cf-mgmt \
  --name cf-mgmt \
  --secret cf-mgmt-secret \
  --authorized_grant_types client_credentials,refresh_token \
  --authorities cloud_controller.admin,scim.read,scim.write
RUN_INTEGRATION_TESTS=true go test ./integration/...
```

## Code Generation

Some portions of this code are autogenerated.  To regenerate them, install the prerequisites:

- `go get -u github.com/jteeuwen/go-bindata/...`
- `go get -u github.com/golang/mock/mockgen`
- `go get -u github.com/maxbrunsfeld/counterfeiter`

### Rebuild mockgen
A recent change to mockgen broke code generation so you must re-build this using the following commit hash `1f837508b8ff6c01edf3bb94cc9d1fc0527f001c` a script has been added to rebuild this binary to fix the issue.

```
./rebuild-mockgen.sh
```

And then run `go generate $(glide nv)` from the project directory, or `go generate .`
from a specific directory.
